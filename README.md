# dsptk
DSP Toolkit is a collection of Digital Signal Processing classes that I'm using to learn the subject.
Already exists a lot of open source libraries so this work may not be useful for anyone except for me.

# TODO
* Classes documentation
* Test coverage
* Download dependencies via cmake so we don't need to manually them.


# Dependencies (Some of them will be dowloaded via cmake)
* cmake
* doxygen
* latex
